This tutorial has the intention to give you a first idea on how to define a continuous (spatial) problem and how optimization algorithms work to solve the particular problem. It introduces Random Search, Simulated Annealing, and Genetic Algorithms. You need knowledge of basic mathematics and Python to understand the code.

To do the tutorial:
- Download conda (I advise miniconda, but it is up to you)
- Start the conda prompt
- Create the environment for the tutorial with the command `conda env create --file environment_opti.yml`
- Start Jupyter Notebook with the command `jupyter notebook`
- In the browser page that opens, select the notebook file Spatial_optimization_practicals_1.ipynb
- Perform the tutorial by reading instructions, studying the code, running the code, and answering the questions
